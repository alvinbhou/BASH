Get the latest computer updates for all your installed software. Use up-to-date antivirus software. Limit user privileges on the computer. Use caution when opening attachments and accepting file transfers. Use caution when clicking on links toWeb pages. Avoid downloading pirated software. Protect yourself against social engineering attacks. Use strong passwords. Enable a firewall on your computer Use a third-party firewall product or turn on the Microsoft Windows Internet Connection Firewall. How to turn on the Windows Firewall in Windows 7 How to turn on theWindows Firewall in Windows Vista How to turn on the Windows firewall in Windows XP Get the latest computer updates Updates help protect your computer from viruses, worms, and other threats as they are discovered. It is important to install updates for all the software that is installed in your computer. These are usually available from vendor Web sites. You can use the Automatic Updates feature in Windows to automatically download future Microsoft security updates while your computer is on and connected to the Internet. How to turn on Automatic Updates in Windows 7 How to turn on Automatic Updates in Windows Vista How to turn on Automatic Updates in Windows XP Use up-to-date antivirus software Most antivirus software can detect and prevent infection by known malicious software. To help protect you from infection, you should always run antivirus software, such as Microsoft Security Essentials,that is updated with the latest signature files. For more information, see http://www.microsoft.com/security/antivirus/av.aspx. Limit user privileges on the computer Starting with Windows Vista and Windows 7, Microsoft introduced User Account Control (UAC), which, when enabled, allowed users to run with least user privileges. This scenario limits the possibility of attacks bymalware and other threats that require administrative privileges to run. You can configure UAC in your computer to meet your preferences: User Account Control in Windows 7 User Account Control in Windows Vista Applying the Principle of Least Privilege in Windows XP More on User Account Control Use caution when opening attachments and accepting file transfers Exercise caution with e-mail and attachmentsreceived from unknown sources, or received unexpectedly from known sources. Use extreme caution when accepting file transfers from known or unknown sources. Use caution when clicking on links to Web pages Exercise caution with links toWeb pages that you receive from unknown sources, especially if the links are to a Web page that you are not familiar with,unsure of the destination of, or suspicious of. Malicious software may be installed in yourcomputer simply by visiting aWeb page with harmful content. Avoid downloading pirated software Threats may also be bundled with software and files that are available for download on various torrent sites. Downloading \"cracked\" or \"pirated\" software from these sites carries not only the risk of being infected with malware, but is also illegal. For more information, see 'The risks of obtaining and using pirated software'. Protect yourself from social engineering attacks While attackers may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in hardware or software to compromise a computer, they also attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in human behavior to do the same. When an attacker attempts to take advantage of human behavior to persuade the affected user to perform an action of the attacker's choice, it is known as 'social engineering'. Essentially, social engineering is an attack against the human interface of the targeted computer. For more information, see 'What is social engineering?'. Use strong passwords Attackers may try to gain access to your Windows account by guessing your password. It is therefore important that you use a strong password 璽 one that cannot be easily guessed by an attacker. A strong password is one that has at least 8 characters, and combines letters, numbers, and symbols. For more information, see http://www.microsoft.com/protect/yourself/password/create.mspx.",

                "tech": "Threat behavior Installation Virus:Win32/Virut.BN might be downloaded and installed by other malware. Spreads via璽礎 File infection The virusdisables Windows System File Protection (SFP) by injecting code into the Windows process \"winlogon.exe\". The injected code modifies the system file \"sfc_os.dll\" in memory which in turn allows the virus to infect files protected by SFP. Virus:Win32/Virut.BN infects .EXE and.SCR files, hence actions such as copying or viewing files with Explorer, includingon shares (with write access) will result in files being infected, and the virus spreading from PC to PC. The virus injects its own code into a system process such as \"explorer.exe\" or\"winlogon.exe\", and hooks low-level (NTDLL layer) Windows API calls in order to stay in memory. It hooks the following functions in each running process (NTDLL.DLL): NtCreateFile NtOpenFile NtCreateProcess NtCreateProcessEx Thus, every time an infected process runs, so does the virus. It also writes code to HTML files that adds a hidden IFrame pointing to the domain \"zief.pl\". When you open an HTML file, the browser connects to this server without you knowing. The HTML page hosted at this location attempts to exploit a number of different vulnerabilities (browser-based and program-specific vulnerabilities) in order to run a copy of the virus. These modified HTML files aredetected as Virus:HTML/Virut.BH. The virus also modifies the local machine's Hosts file, redirecting the domain \"zief.pl\" to local host (127.0.0.1) so thatalready-infected PCs will notrun the remotely-hosted copy of the virus. Payload Allows backdoor access and control Virut.BNtries to connect toInternet Relay Channel (IRC) server \"irc.zief.pl\"through port 80 using a particular channel. Should this fail, it instead attempts to connect to \"proxim.ircgalaxy.pl\" also using port 80. It contains functionality to download and run files on your PC. This may include additional malware. The backdoor can also be used to change the host that it connects to for control. Analysis by Dan Kurc Prevention Take these steps to help prevent infection on your PC.",
